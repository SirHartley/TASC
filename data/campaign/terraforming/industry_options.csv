# project is a | separated list of projects as specified in 'terraforming_projects.csv'. They contain requirements, duration, duration modifiers, etc that control what this industry does
# enable_setting handled by projects' enable_setting
# durations_with_conditions and dynamic_project_duration_modifiers both handled by projects' base_project_duration and dynamic_project_duration_modifiers
# resource and resource_step handled by projects' resources_to_progress
# requirement_needed handled by projects' requirements
# requirement_suitable and requirement_suitable_hidden not handled by projects, these are whether the building can be made and needs two, one for buildable, the other for in the list
# conditions_added_on_completion and conditions_removed_on_completion handled by projects' conditions_added and conditions_removed
# Resource step is how much the resource should increase, per resource
