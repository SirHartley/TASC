# project is a | separated list of 'project ; intelTooltip ; intelCompletedMessage' with project as specified in 'terraforming_projects.csv'. They contain requirements, duration, duration modifiers, etc that control what this industry does. intelTooltip and intelCompletedMessage are optional, but intelTooltip must be specified for intelCompletedMessage to be specified
# requirements and requirements_hidden not handled by projects, these are only whether the building can be built. They also need a reason paired with it for display purposes. May be able to change it in the future, but for now, no
