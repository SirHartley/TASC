id,requirement_type,invert,data
# These are individual requirements, the basic building blocks of larger requirements used in terraforming_requirements.csv
# id is a string to identify the project, unique to 'terraforming_requirement.csv'
# requirement_type is a requirement type for this requirement
# invert is whether this condition will be inverted, ie a condition for a planet to be a certain type becomes a condition for a planet to NOT be a certain type
# data is a string that specifies options for the requirement type
# PlanetTypeRequirement requires the planet to be the type specified in data. Planet types are in 'planet_types.csv'
# MarketHasCondition requires the planet to have the condition specified in data
# MarketHasWaterPresent requires the planet to have a certain amount of water. Water amounts are specified in 'planet_types.csv'
# MarketHasIndustry requires the planet to have a certain industry.
# WorldTypeSupportsResourceImprovement requires the planet's specified resource to be below the maximum specified in 'planet_types.csv'
# TerraformingPossibleOnMarket requires the planet to be able to be terraformed, as specified in 'planet_types.csv'
# FocusPlanetTypeRequirement and FocusMarketHasCondition are the same as PlanetTypeRequirement and MarketHasCondition, but check the planet the station is orbiting
