id,tooltip,invert_all,requirements
# id is a string to identify the project, unique to 'terraforming_requirements.csv'
# tooltip is the user displayed string shown to display the requirement conditions
# invert_all is whether the result of checking all the requirements will be inverted
# requirements is a | separated list of requirement IDs as specified in 'terraforming_requirement.csv'. These are checked in an OR manner, ie only one of the requirements has to be true for this check to return true

# Token replacements can be used in tooltips. Available token replacements depend on the specific requirement used. Some token replacements may themselves be replaced if there are multiple requirements listed.
