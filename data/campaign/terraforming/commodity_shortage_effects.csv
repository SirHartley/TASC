# I can't think of any good way to automatically tie commodity shortages to effects since you might want the maximum deficit of a market size and a flat commodity, or the sum of deficits to tie to give a flatt penalty to upkeep, etc
# So just do the effects independently and rely on humans to keep things in line
# I hate it
# Each demand shortage effect checks its commodities however it needs to, and then applies the effects to the given industry
# This can also be used as a general way to add effects to industries, such as Genelab's bonus to Mesozoic Park's income, or the condition dependent change in Kletka Simulators' upkeep. Finding that the squareish peg fits into the square hole with this one.
# id is a unique identifier for each demand shortage effect
# enable_settings is the settings that have to be enabled for this demand shortage effect to be active
# commodity_shortage_effect_type is the type of this commodity demand shortage effect
# commodities_demanded is a | separated list of commodities that will be checked for deficits
# data is demand type specific data
# DeficitToInactive requires no specific data. If there's a shortage, the industry becomes non-functional
# DeficitToCommodity is a "commodity_to_deficit1 | commodity_to_deficity2 | etc" list. Maximum deficit of the first collection is applied to all the commodities in the second collection.
# DeficitMultiplierToUpkeep is a "float". If any of the commodities in the first collection are in deficit, the upkeep is multiplied by the float.
# ConditionToUpkeep is a horrible, horrible hack for Kletka Simulator. "commodities_demanded" is ignored. "data" is a | separated collection of "condition ; upkeep_multiplier" pairs.
# TagToUpkeep is the same as ConditionToUpkeep but is for tags instead of conditions, and includes a third description component in each element ie "tag ; upkeep_multiplier ; description"
# RequirementsToResetProgress is a | separated list of requirements Is as specified in 'terraforming_requirements.csv'. If any of the requirements is met, industry project progress is reset
